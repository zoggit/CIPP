The current Microsoft partner landscape makes it fairly hard to manage multi tenant situations, with loads of manual work. Microsoft Lighthouse might resolve this in the future but development of this is lagging far behind development of the current market for Microsoft Partners. This project is a way to help you with administration, with user management, and deploying your own preferred standards. It's not a replacement for security tools, or a way to cut costs on specific subscriptions. The tool should assist you in removing the gripes with standard partner management and save you several hours per engineer per month. Deployment and Getting Started \u00b6 If you want to self-host, check out the installation manual . You will need some knowledge of Static Web Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure KeyVault Why are you making this? \u00b6 I'm kind of done waiting for vendors to catch up to what we actually need. All RMM vendors are dramaticaly slow adopting cloud management. Microsoft themselves don't understand the Managed services markets, there are vendors that have tried jumping into the gap but either have unreasonable fees, weird constructions, require Global Admins without MFA, or just don't innovate at a pace that is required of cloud services right now. I'm also annoyed the untransparant behaviour that many companies in our market are showing. Most are claiming that working with the Microsoft Partner APIs is difficult, and requires a very heavy development team. I'm a guy that had no webdesign knowledge before this and created the first release of this app in 3 weekends. Vendors that claim high difficulty or issues with integration are simply not giving this any priority. This is also why the changelog contains how many hours I've spend to built each release. These hours are directly taken from my VSCode Extensions. I was recently on a call with one of my friends and he said he was changing the world. That insipred me to change the world just a little bit too. :) I'm hoping that this is one of the tools that make you smile. What's the pricing? \u00b6 This project is FREE but we do have a Sponsorware component. The sponsorware structure for this project is pretty simple; the code is available to everyone and free to use. You will need some technical know-how to put it all together. Sponsors receive the following benefits For users of the project that sponsor: \u00b6 The project will be hosted for you. The hosted version will always be the latest release and automatically updated. You'll also receive a staging environment with the latest (nightly/beta) build, to see new features before anyone else. You will receive priority on support issues reported on Github. You will be able to make 1 priortized feature request per month. Sponsorship allows me to sink some more time into this project and keep it free, so please consider it. :) For company sponsors, depending on sponsor level you can get the following benefits; \u00b6 Your company logo will be featured on this readme page at the top. Your company logo will be featured on https://cyberdrain.com A small version of your company logo with a link to your homepage will be on the footer, each user will see this on each page. What is the functionality? \u00b6 The current build functionality is described below, also check out our Changelog in the documentation folder. Any unmarked items are in development. General \u00b6 Allow adding/removing tenants to skip Create two user levels for access to settings: User and Admin, Admin can add exclusions/remove exclusions/access complete logs. Allow export of logs to SIEM/External SOC Applications \u00b6 List all applications in tenants List installation status of a specific application per device Add/Remove custom applications via win32(intunewin) to multiple tenants Add Office Apps to multiple tenants Add/Remove Chocolatey Apps to multiple tenants Add/Remove Ninite Pro Apps to multiple tenants Assign Apps to All Devices or All Users Report on installation status Assign apps to specific groups Devices \u00b6 Add autopilot configuration Add Enrollment Status Pages Add Autopilot Devices Add Administrative templates / Policies Users \u00b6 List all administered users with tenant filtering options Convert user to shared mailbox View/edit licenses List users Add/Remove users to groups User alerting Tenant Administration \u00b6 Deploy any custom graph command Set selected defaults across selected tenants Monitor defaults across tenants. Tenant Alerting Security \u00b6 Authentication is handled by Azure AD using static web apps security. This means the API is only reachable for authenticated users you've invited. For most of the security info related to that check out our staticwebapp.config.json and/or the doc pages on static web apps. Do you see something that might be a security risk, even the smallest? report it and we will handle it asap. Check out our security reporting options Contributions \u00b6 Feel free to send pull requests or fill out issues when you encounter them, sponsors get a priority on issues and bugs. I'm also completely open to adding direct maintainers/contributors and working together. If you decide to contribute; remember that keeping the portal fast is a key component. CIPP is supposed to go brrrrr, any improvements that help with speed are welcomed. Welcomed changes/contributions in no particular order \u00b6 the code quality and repetive code on the functions can use some work HTML and JQuery definitely needs consolidation and improvement, as I am not a web developer I did what I could... :) Spelling and grammar check, both of APIs and the actual text. Special thanks \u00b6 I'd like to give special thanks to the people that made this project possible; Kyle Hansloven Ray Orsini The Team at MSP.zone/MSP'R'Us Gavin Stone at MSPGeek MSP2.0 for helping with some visual input.

There's a couple of things to keep in mind; These repositories are going through rapid changes. Every pull request should update version_latest.txt with versioning that follows https://semver.org Speed and Security are two of our pillars, if it isn't fast, it isn't good, and if it isn't secure, it can't be accepted :) We try to use native APIs over Powershell Modules. Powershell modules tend to slow the entire processing. We currently only have Az.Keyvault and Az.Accounts loaded and prefer to keep it that way. The interface is made entirely in Bootstrap and Jquery. For Datatables we use the JQuery Datatables plugin. Avoid adding a deploy YML to your development repo. We'll remove those, but it's just an annoyance. If you want to both deploy and develop it's better to create two instances of the repo. When contributing, or planning to contribute, please create an issue in the tracker here . If you are fixing a bug, file a complete bug report and assign it to yourself, if you are adding a feature, please add \"Feature Request\" to the title and assign it to yourself. Feature requests \u00b6 Feature requests that request integration with anything but M365 will be closed. We're not integrating directly with third party products until version 2.0. Pull requests that have integration components will be discussed and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Pull Requests \u00b6 We do not accept PRs or commits against Master. Master is always the final version. For both CIPP and CIPP-API we have two branches. Dev and Master. Please make any PR against Dev, when Dev is promoted to final we'll PR that against master. Naming Standards \u00b6 We follow a naming standard, as based on the name a user might get access to an API or not. Our current naming standard is as follows; ListBla - Everything that generates a list (users) EditBla - Anything that edits an exisiting object (edit user) AddBla - Anything that adds an object (add user) RemoveBla - Anything that deletes or removes an object (remove user) ExecBla - Anything that executes an action (send mfa request to user) Creating two instances \u00b6 Make a clone of your forked repo Optional: mark this repo as private Add the following github action, this will sync the repos every hour: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 # This is a basic workflow that is manually triggered name: Pull from master schedule # Controls when the action will run.

You'll need a local development environment. I'm assuming you have some programming experience. You'll need a couple of tools to get started Install node.js Install .NET Core 2 SDK and .NET Core 5 SDK After installation execute the following commands: 1 2 npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@3 After these are installed, you can start a local development instance of the Azure Functions(APIs) the Static web app(Frontend) or both Starting only the frontend: 1 swa start \"C:\\PathToYourLocallyDownloadedFrontEn\" --swa-config-location \"C:\\AnyInvalidPath\" We use an invalid path on purpose, because our config in the CIPP folder only works for cloud engines and not the local emulator. Starting only the APIs: 1 2 3 4 func start --script-root \"C:\\FolderTo\\CIPP-API\" ``` For starting both, we recommend two separate instances. You can also have the SWA utility start the API but this brings in some added difficulties because you can't see the API logs directly in the console. func start --script-root \"C:\\FolderTo\\CIPP-API\" swa start \"C:\\PathToYourLocallyDownloadedFrontEn\" --swa-config-location \"C:\\AnyInvalidPath\" --api-location http://localhost:7071/ ``` If you need the APIs to connect to M365 and use the secure application model you'll also need to make a local.settings.json file inside of the CIPP-API folder. This file is added to .gitignore so it will not be pushed. This file contains the secure application model keys, and a Azure Storage connection string for the durable function queues.

There's a couple of things to keep in mind; These repositories are going through rapid changes. Every pull request should update version_latest.txt with versioning that follows https://semver.org Speed and Security are two of our pillars, if it isn't fast, it isn't good, and if it isn't secure, it can't be accepted :) We try to use native APIs over Powershell Modules. Powershell modules tend to slow the entire processing. We currently only have Az.Keyvault and Az.Accounts loaded and prefer to keep it that way. The interface is made entirely in Bootstrap and Jquery. For Datatables we use the JQuery Datatables plugin. Avoid adding a deploy YML to your development repo. We'll remove those, but it's just an annoyance. If you want to both deploy and develop it's better to create two instances of the repo.

information A fork of the CIPP GitHub repository. A fork of the CIPP API GitHub repository. An active Azure Subscription. A GitHub Personal Access Token. You can find instructions on what you need and the minimum permissions to do this in Microsoft's Azure Static Web Apps documentation . You only need to follow the \"Create a GitHub Personal Access Token\" section. Automated Installation \u00b6 After you have completed the prerequisites in the Getting Started section above, click the button below to run the automated setup. This does most of the work for you. If you don't want to use the automated installer, use the manual installation instructions below, but be warned that this is really not advised, there's a lot of moving parts where one could make a mistake. You will need to use the manual installation instructions if you wish to host your repo in Azure DevOps or on a GitLab instance. I can't deploy in my region \u00b6 This is because the Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) component is global by default (it picks the datacenter closest to you) however some regions don't allow deployment. Regions that allow SWA at the moment are Central US, East US 2, East Asia, West Europe and West US 2. To work around this use the alternative installation button below. This will deploy the Static Web App in Central US region however the SWA will still be served from your nearest datacenter and other parts of CIPP will be located in the region you chose so you won't notice any latency. Adding users to CIPP \u00b6 After deployment, go to your resource group in Azure and click on your Static Web App ( cipp-swa-xxxx if using automatic deployment). Click on Role Management and invite the users you want. Currently we support three roles, reader , editor , and admin . More info about the roles can be found on the Roles page. You should now be able to browse to the custom domain or the default domain, and use the CIPP control panel. It's not working, I'm having issues \u00b6 For the first 30 minutes or more the application will respond pretty slowly, this is because, among other things, the Function App (CIPP-API) has to download PowerShell modules from Microsoft. We can't make this run any faster at this time. If you have waited for at least 30 minutes and things are still not working restart the Azure Function App (Azure Portal > CIPP Resource Group > Function App > Overview > Restart), this solves 99,9% of all issues. Turn it off, turn it on again. ;) If you are still stuck, check out the FAQ page and if needed - create an issue on GitHub or seek help on the CIPP Discord Updating CIPP \u00b6 To update CIPP to a new version see the updating section of this documentation. Adding a custom domain name \u00b6 At the moment of deployment, the application will use a randomly generated name. To change this, go to your Resource Group in Azure, click on your Static Web App ( cipp-swa-xxxx if using automatic deployment) and click on Custom Domains. You'll be able to add your own domain name here. Microsoft Docs - Set up a custom domain with free certificate in Azure Static Web Apps Manual Instructions - Here be Dragons \u00b6 If you don't want to, or can't, install CIPP automatically you can use the following steps to create the required Azure services manually. Create an Azure Function host \u00b6 Create an Azure Function App and upload the data from the CIPP-API to the Azure Function, or attach it to your fork. Each time we update the central repository you must also update your fork to keep current. After creating the Azure function, Enable system managed identity for the Azure Function. Microsoft Docs - How to use managed identities for App Service and Azure Functions Give the managed identity \"Reader\" access on the Azure Subscription. Microsoft Docs - Assign Azure Roles to a managed identity Create an Azure Key Vault \u00b6 Create an Azure Key Vault and give the system managed identity access to update, read, and create Secrets. This keyvault will be used to store credentials and tokens for the application. Microsoft Docs - Assign a Key Vault access policy Create an Azure Static Web App \u00b6 Create a premium Azure Static Web App in the Azure portal and use the CIPP repository fork you've made as the source. Each time an update is executed you must pull the latest changes into your fork and push (deploy) these to the Static Web App. This deployment can be automated with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitLab CI/CD (and/or other CI/CD tools).

The Best Practice concept of this has been wideless discussed with numerous MSPs. Most of these Best Practices have been derived from the standards portion of CIPP. The Best Practice Analyser is entirely read only. It will not make any changes to your tenants. Current known issues / Limitations \u00b6 The final plan will be to have the data refresh once a day. With version 1.2.0 you will need to refresh the data manually. How do I get started? \u00b6 In the left hand menu, navigate to Tenant Administration > Standards > Best Practice Analyser . If this is your first ever run you may see an error initially because there is no data; this is expected. How do I refresh or generate the data? \u00b6 At the top of the page there is button called Force Refresh All Data . You only need to click this once. Interpreting Results \u00b6 The reporting here generally follows a standard colour theming. Red is bad and generally not something that should be happening on your tenant. Orange is either a warning or subjective. It does not necessarily indicate something is wrong. Green means there are no issues or the setting is set in a manner that is generally agreed as Best Practice. Unified Audit Log Enabled \u00b6 This Best Practice checks that on your tenants that the Unified Audit Log is enabled. This is 365's major log and contains user, group, application, domain and directory activities. This absolutely should be enabled. Security Defaults Enabled \u00b6 This Best Practice is a check to see if Security Defaults are enabled. Security Defaults are preconfigured security settings that apply against your tenant that ensure things like MFA is enabled, legacy authentication protocols are blocked etc. The enabling of this is subjective, which is why it being turned off denotes an orange warning. Message Copy for Sent As \u00b6 This is a clickable button which will show you individual accounts where this is not enabled. This refers to the Automatic saving of sent items in delegators mailbox. Mailboxes in Microsoft 365 or Office 365 can be set up so that someone (such as an executive assistant) can access the mailbox of another person (such as a manager) and send mail as them. These people are often called the delegate and the delegator, respectively. We'll call them \"assistant\" and \"manager\" for simplicity's sake. When an assistant is granted access to a manager's mailbox, it's called delegated access. People often set up delegated access and send permissions to allow an assistant to manage a manager's calendar where they need to send and respond to meeting requests. By default, when an assistant sends mail as, or on behalf of, a manager, the sent message is stored in the assistant's Sent Items folder and not in the Managers. It is possible to set it so that the Manager gets it put in to their sent items too. This Best Practice is checking that these settings are enabled for people who has Send As and Send on Behalf. The enabling of this is subjective, which is why when it's off it denotes an orange warning. User Cannot Consent to Apps \u00b6 This Best Practice checks whether users can give consent to apps that use OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 for sign-in and requests to access data. An app can be created from within your own organization, or it can come from another Office 365 organization or a third-party. It is a well known best practice that users SHOULD NOT be able to give consent to apps. If this setting is on, this denotes a red warning. This is a security risk you should mitigate. Passwords do not Expire \u00b6 This setting is checking whether the tenant has set passwords to expire or not. It is general best practice now that passwords SHOULD NOT expire. If Password Expiry is on, this will generate a red alert. Privacy in Reports Enabled \u00b6 A number of the reports that pre-generate in Microsoft 365 have personally identifiable information (like a users name). This makes reporting very difficult. We believe this is better disabled to enable for more accurate reporting, which brings security benefits on its own. This however is subjective, so if Privacy in Reports is Enabled, you will receive an orange warning. Self Service Password Reset Enabled \u00b6 This is an organisational setting that when enabled allows users to reset their own passwords through a forgot your password type identification. There are three possible results here. Self Service Password Reset is Off all Users, On all User, On Specific Users. The enabling of this is subjective so when this is not enabled you will receive an orange warning. Modern Auth Enabled \u00b6 Modern authentication is a core security component of 365 and allows for authentication features like MFA, smart cards, third-party SAML providers etc. This should absolutely be enabled, and when it isn't you will be presented with a red error. Shared Mailboxes Logins Disabled \u00b6 This is a clickable button, which will show a modal popup with the accounts that are meeting this criteria. This is a check to see if you have shared mailboxes attached to a valid account that can still login. Shared mailboxes in nearly all cases should not have a login account attached to it. We see this mostly when a user leaves a business, they are converted from a paid license to a free shared mailbox, and the license is removed. This still leaves an active account linked to the shared mailbox, even if the password has been changed this increases risk unnecessarily. Where you have any of these accounts, the result is red. Unused Licenses \u00b6 This is a clickable button which will show you where you have unused licenses. This goes through all the licenses that are assigned in every tenant and compares the purchased number with the number consumed. Where there is a difference in this number this is normally because you have licenses that you are paying for, but are not being used. We are whitelisting common licenses that don't matter, for example unassigned free licenses or trials. If you have any SKUs you wish us to whitelist from this check please raise an enhancement request in Github. I am having Problems \u00b6 Please ensure that you have given adequate time for the Best Practice Analyser to run. In an environment with 100 tenants this takes on average 15 minutes. Please ensure that your permissions are correct by going in to CIPP Settings > Configuration Settings > Run Permission Check . Make sure your CIPP-API and CIPP modules are both fully up-to-date.

Please note - clicking More at the end of each row will give you extended information about the problems identified. Current known issues / Limitations \u00b6 You may get odd results if you have different records setup for subdomains.

Microsoft Secure Score \u00b6 This is Microsoft Secure Score as found in 365 tenants here: Tenant Secure Score . For further information on how to improve 365 tenant security using Secure Score actions see Microsoft's documentation here . In many cases the CIPP Standards will result in improvements in a tenant's Secure Score. SPF Pass Test \u00b6 This is looking primarily for two conditions; that you are using the recommended SPF record that Microsoft suggests. It also looks to ensure that your domains are set to hard fail as opposed to soft fail. MX Pass Test \u00b6 This is looking to ensure that your MX record is set correctly based on what Microsoft thinks it should be. Where this is failing you likely have a domain in your 365 tenant that is using e-mail elsewhere, or has a misconfigured MX record. DMARC Present \u00b6 This is the first of a number of tests that we are performing on the DMARC record. First we are making sure one exists; your domains absolutely should have a properly configured DMARC or you are putting this domain at risk of being spoofed. DMARC Action Policy \u00b6 Your DMARC record is only as good as the action set on it. If you have never added a DMARC record before, you'll want to start by creating a record in reporting only, and utilising a service like report-uri.com to assess reports. The ideal setting for this is Reject. DMARC % Pass \u00b6 It is possible to configure your DMARC to only pay attention to a certain percent of mail. This test makes sure it is assessing 100% of it. DNSSEC \u00b6 DNSSEC is the \"Domain Name System Security Extensions) and is a feature of DNS that authenticates responses to domain name lookups, preventing attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests. This test is a simple enable/disable test. DKIM Enabled \u00b6 DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an email security standard designed to make sure messages aren't altered in transit between the sending and recipient servers.
