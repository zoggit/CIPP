## Prerequisites

For the installation and maintenance, we assume you have some knowledge of GitHub (or Git in general), and have setup the Secure Application Model prior to install. 

* Haven't setup the Secure Application model yet? Check out [this CyberDrain blog post](https://www.cyberdrain.com/connect-to-exchange-online-automated-when-mfa-is-enabled-using-the-secureapp-model/). 
* For a step-by-step guide to setting up the Secure Application Model, see [this Gavsto blog post](https://www.gavsto.com/secure-application-model-for-the-layman-and-step-by-step/).

??? tip "Just the code."
    If you're just looking for the SAM script - you can find it below:

    ```powershell

        [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)]
        [string]$TenantId
    )

You'll also need the following permissions for your secure application model, to add permissions follow these instructions:

* Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
* Click on [**Azure Active Directory**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview), now click on [**App Registrations**](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps).
* Find your Secure App Model application. You can search based on the Application ID.
* Go to **API Permissions** and click **Add a permission**.
* Choose “Microsoft Graph” and “Delegated permission” or "Application Permissions"
* Add the permission you need
* Finally, click on “Grant Admin Consent” for Company Name.

## Permissions

For full functionality, you'll need the following permissions for your Secure Application Model. You can remove any permissions if you do not want the application to be able to use that functionality.

!!! info "Duplicate Permissions"
    Some permissions may appear to be duplicated in the Delegated and Application permissions tables below. This is *by design* and you do need to add both permissions!

### Delegated Permissions

## Getting started with CIPP

You'll need the following to get started;

* Your Secure Application Model information
* A fork of [the CIPP GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP) repository.
* A fork of [the CIPP API GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP-API) repository.
* An active Azure Subscription.
* A GitHub Personal Access Token. You can find instructions on what you need and the minimum permissions to do this [in Microsoft's Azure Static Web Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/publish-azure-resource-manager?tabs=azure-cli#create-a-github-personal-access-token). You only need to follow the "Create a GitHub Personal Access Token" section.

## Automated Installation

After you have completed the prerequisites in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-cipp) section above, click the button below to run the automated setup. This does most of the work for you. If you don't want to use the automated installer, use the [manual installation instructions](#manual-instructions-here-be-dragons) below, but be warned that this is really not advised, there's a lot of moving parts where one could make a mistake. You will need to use the manual installation instructions if you wish to host your repo in [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) or on a [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) instance.

[![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FKelvinTegelaar%2FCIPP%2Fmaster%2FDocumentation%2FAzureDeploymentTemplate.json)

### I can't deploy in my region

This is because the Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) component is global by default (it picks the datacenter closest to you) however some regions don't allow deployment. Regions that allow SWA at the moment are Central US, East US 2, East Asia, West Europe and West US 2.  To work around this use the alternative installation button below. This will deploy the Static Web App in Central US region however the SWA will still be served from your nearest datacenter and other parts of CIPP will be located in the region you chose so you won't notice any latency.

[![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FKelvinTegelaar%2FCIPP%2Fmaster%2FDocumentation%2FAzureDeploymentTemplate_regionoptions.json)

## Adding users to CIPP

After deployment, go to your resource group in Azure and click on your Static Web App (`cipp-swa-xxxx` if using automatic deployment). Click on Role Management and invite the users you want. Currently we support three roles, `reader`, `editor`, and `admin`. More info about the roles can be found on the [Roles](Roles.md) page.

You should now be able to browse to the custom domain or the default domain, and use the CIPP control panel. 

## It's not working, I'm having issues

For the first 30 minutes or more the application will respond pretty slowly, this is because, among other things, the Function App (CIPP-API) has to download PowerShell modules from Microsoft. We can't make this run any faster at this time. If you have waited for at least 30 minutes and things are still not working restart the Azure Function App (Azure Portal > CIPP Resource Group > Function App > Overview > Restart), this solves 99,9% of all issues. Turn it off, turn it on again. ;)

If you are still stuck, check out the [FAQ](FAQ.md) page and if needed - create an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP/issues) or seek help [on the CIPP Discord](https://discord.gg/cyberdrain)

## Updating CIPP

To update CIPP to a new version see the [updating](Updating.md) section of this documentation.

## Adding a custom domain name

At the moment of deployment, the application will use a randomly generated name. To change this, go to your Resource Group in Azure, click on your Static Web App (`cipp-swa-xxxx` if using automatic deployment) and click on Custom Domains. You'll be able to add your own domain name here. [Microsoft Docs - Set up a custom domain with free certificate in Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/custom-domain?tabs=azure-dns)

## Manual Instructions - Here be Dragons

If you don't want to, or can't, install CIPP automatically you can use the following steps to create the required Azure services manually.

### Create an Azure Function host

Create an Azure Function App and upload the data from the CIPP-API to the Azure Function, or attach it to your fork. Each time we update the central repository you must also update your fork to keep current. 

After creating the Azure function, Enable system managed identity for the Azure Function. [Microsoft Docs - How to use managed identities for App Service and Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-identity?toc=%2Fazure%2Fazure-functions%2Ftoc.json&tabs=powershell)

Give the managed identity "Reader" access on the Azure Subscription. [Microsoft Docs - Assign Azure Roles to a managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity)

### Create an Azure Key Vault

Create an Azure Key Vault and give the system managed identity access to update, read, and create Secrets. This keyvault will be used to store credentials and tokens for the application. [Microsoft Docs - Assign a Key Vault access policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?tabs=azure-portal)

### Create an Azure Static Web App

Create a premium Azure Static Web App in the Azure portal and use the CIPP repository fork you've made as the source. Each time an update is executed you must pull the latest changes into your fork and push (deploy) these to the Static Web App. This deployment can be automated with GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitLab CI/CD (and/or other CI/CD tools).

After creation, perform the following changes:

* Attach the Function App to the Static Web App. [Microsoft Docs - Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/functions-bring-your-own)
